# find-the-max-min-and-average
I have used 6 funtions.They are randomlyFill, displayGrades, getMax, getMin, getAvg and getStd.
randomlyFill function is useful for assigned grades from 0 to 100.
displayGrades function is useful for writing for grades of students.
getMax function is useful to find max grade.
getMin function is useful to find min grade.
getAvg function is useful to find average grade.
getStd function is useful to calculate the standard deviation from an array of student grades.
